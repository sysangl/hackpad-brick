This was a hackpad built for Hackclub's YSWS. Check them out [[here]] (https://hackclub.com/)!

## Overview
I'm lazy, so what better thing to do than spend hours learning how to and trying to design a PCB and case for a macro pad, just so I can save milliseconds pressing one key instead of two.s

After days of wondering which way diodes should face in a keyboard matrix, I present the macroPAD (such original naming, i know).

## TODO
- I will finish/refine the KMK code when I have the PCB
- Design an angled stand.
- Rotary Encoder Knob.

## Features
- Outfitted with enough keys to play games such as Minecraft
- Quick-switch keybind profiles, in case you're like me and keep switching between something productive and something not
- Nice little OLED screen for all the customisation you would never need
- And, an integrated stand built into the case (if I remembered to add it)

## CASE
The case went through 4 major redesigns, and will probably change again in the future.

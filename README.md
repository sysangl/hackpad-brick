## Overview
I'm lazy, so what better thing to do than spend hours learning how to and trying to design a PCB and case for a macro pad, just so I can save milliseconds pressing one key instead of two.

After days of wondering which way diodes should face in a keyboard matrix, I present the macroPAD (such original naming, i know).

## TODO
- I will finish the KMK code when I have the PCB
- Design a angleed stand. (I will print this by myself)
- Rotary Encoder Knob. (Will self-print)

## Features
- Outfitted with enough keys to play games such as Minecraft
- Quick-switch keybind profiles, in case you're like me and keep switching between something productive and something not
- Nice little OLED screen for all the customisation you would never need
- And, an integrated stand built into the case (if I remembered to add it)
